		<h1>Holiday Reading List</h1>

		<p>Twas the day after classes, when all through the school <br />
		Not a student was stirring, as a general rule. <br />
		The textbooks were left by the chimney to burn, <br />
		In hopes that those lessons would never return.</p>

		<p>The students were nestled all snug in their beds, <br />
		While visions of coding swirled in their heads. <br />
		The profs at their desks, in full grading-mode, <br />
		With coffee in hand, for marking overload.</p>

		<p>When out in the hall arose such a clatter, <br />
		I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter. <br />
		Away to the door I flew like a flash, <br />
		To see one last student fly by in a dash!</p>

		<p>They wanted more books, texts, and articles to read. <br />
		Lucky for them, I could satisfy that need. <br />
		I cobbled together a list with such speed, <br />
		And left that list with with the student to read:</p>
